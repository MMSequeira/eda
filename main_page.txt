/** \mainpage Introduction
 *
 * This is the complete documentation of the code developed in the context of 
 * Estrutura de Dados e Algoritmos, an [ISLA Campus Lisboa | Laureate
 * International Universities](http://www.isla.pt/) course.
 *
 * This is classical C documentation, containing the description of the
 * interface of each public artifact, possibly also describing its contract. The
 * documentation is generated automatically from C comments with a specific
 * format. The documentation generator used is [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/),
 * which we highly recommend.
 *
 * If you are a student, this documentation may have some value for you. But you
 * probably want to start by checking the teacher's literate programming style
 * comment pages produced with the help of
 * [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/). You may find them
 * [here](http://mmsequeira.github.com/eda/docs/).
 *
 * If you are looking for the complete source code, [it is available in
 * GitHub](https://github.com/MMSequeira/eda).
